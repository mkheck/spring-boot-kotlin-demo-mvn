Re-creation of: 
    https://github.com/mkheck/spring-boot-kotlin-demo

Which is a fork of:
    https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-boot-kotlin-demo

Using Maven instead of Gradle.

NOTE: This is a scratch project, a work in progress. Star for updates and fork as you like, just know it will change. Hopefully frequently. :)
